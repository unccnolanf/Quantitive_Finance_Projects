# Quantitative Finance Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of my self-developed and learned Python projects for quantitative finance and financial data analysis. Each project demonstrates practical skills in financial modeling, simulation, and data processing.

## Projects Included

### 1. Stock Price Moving Average
- Implements a simple moving average (SMA) strategy for stock prices.
- Calculates and visualizes price trends.
- Use case: backtesting basic momentum strategies.

### 2. Monte Carlo Bettor
- Simulates betting strategies using Monte Carlo methods.
- Tests risk management and bankroll scenarios.
- Use case: exploring probability distributions and loss risk.

### 3. Portfolio Return Simulator
- Builds and analyzes multi-asset portfolios.
- Uses real or sample stock data to estimate returns.
- Use case: stress-testing portfolios with random sampling.

## Why This Exists

These projects showcase my ability to apply Python to practical financial and quantitative problems. This demonstrates hands-on experience beyond classroom learning or certifications.

## How to Use

Each project is organized in its own folder with clear Python scripts. Clone the repository, navigate to the folder youâ€™re interested in, and run the code in your Python environment.
